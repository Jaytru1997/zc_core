## Description

The Zuri Chat Core (ZC_Core) is an open source API that serves as the backend and backbone of Zuri Chat - an open source slack clone developed during the HNG8 internship program 

Zuri Chat implements a plug-in system that allows for much more functionality because different plugins can be developed by different creators. These plugins can then rest on the Zuri Chat Core backbone (ZC_Core) which is written in **Golang**

## Language

ZC_Core was written in Go because it is a fast, compiled language and it is easily scaled. Concurrency in Go is also ideal for implementing a plugin structure. This makes it easy to build on the project and allows for future expansion.
* [Golang](https://golang.org)

## API Documentation

A list of the endpoints and the functions they implement can be found [here](https://docs.zuri.chat/) detailing information about the all API resources.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you can setup your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

1. **Go 1.16** or  **lastest version** already installed on your local machine.
2. MongoDB

### Installation
1. Run an instance of MongoDB
```bash
$ mongod
```


2. Create and populate a `.env` file with its keys corresponding values as listed in `example.env`
3. Run zc_core from project root directory
```bash
$ cd /path/to/zc_core
$ go run main.go
```
### Testing
1. Lint checks are done with [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) - an aggregator of linters
```bash
$ cd /path/to/zc_core
$ golangci-lint run --timeout 2m
```
2. Automated unit and integration tests done with golang's builtin [`testing`](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) package. 
```bash
$ go test -v ./...  -cover
